I am an undergraduate studying Computer Science & Engineering at POSTECH.
I have a strong interest in programming, mathematics, and languages. 
I'm fascinated by languages in general, with a particular focus on those from East Asian cultures.

I've recently developed an interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly deep learning. 
I'm consistently studying computer vision, natural language processing, and multi-modal learning.
I'm also deeply interested in social issues and enjoy analyzing them through various data-driven empirical studies or engaging in normative debates.
I have a great passion for movies and classical music!
